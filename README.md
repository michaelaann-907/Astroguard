# Astroguard

## About  
Astroguard is a 3D educational game designed to teach Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) concepts to Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  

## Project Overview  
Developed in just 2 months with no prior game development experience, Astroguard was my capstone project, built using Unreal Engine’s visual scripting system. The project was supported by my university’s Computer Science department, and my advisor encouraged me to present it at a cybersecurity conference in Washington, D.C. It was also submitted to the AMCIS TREO conference.
