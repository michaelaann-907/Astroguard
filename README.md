## Project Overview  

Astroguard immerses players in **real-world cybersecurity scenarios**, where they must complete tasks that reinforce security principles. The goal was to create a more engaging and **hands-on approach** to learning cybersecurity concepts rather than relying solely on text-based instruction.

I chose **3D over 2D** because **adults tend to find 3D games more engaging**. The added depth and interactivity make security tasks feel more **realistic**, enhancing the learning experience.

## Why Unreal Engine?  

When selecting a game engine, I considered several factors:  
- **High-quality graphics** â€“ Unreal Engine provides realistic lighting, reflections, and detailed environments, which were essential for creating an immersive spaceship setting.  
- **Scalability** â€“ While *Astroguard* started as a standalone project, Unrealâ€™s capabilities allow for potential future expansions, including multiplayer support or VR adaptation.  
- **Physics & Interaction** â€“ Unrealâ€™s built-in physics engine, AI tools, and real-time rendering made it ideal for simulating spaceship mechanics and security-related gameplay elements.  
- **Industry Standard for High-Fidelity Games** â€“ Many AAA studios use Unreal for its cutting-edge rendering and performance optimization tools, ensuring *Astroguard* could deliver a polished experience.

## Game Engine Comparison  

| **Engine**        | **Learning Curve** | **Scalability**                              | **Pros**                                                                 | **Cons**                                                             |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unreal Engine** | Steep             | Best for large-scale AAA projects, realistic graphics | - Advanced graphics capabilities  <br> - Blueprint visual scripting <br> - Suitable for large-scale, high-fidelity projects | - Steeper learning curve for beginners <br> - Higher system requirements <br> - Royalty fees after a certain revenue threshold |
| **Unity**        | Moderate          | Best for small to mid-sized 3D & 2D projects, some large projects possible | - User-friendly interface <br> - Extensive documentation and community support <br> - Versatile for 2D and 3D development | - May require additional optimization for large-scale projects <br> - Graphics capabilities may not match Unreal Engine for high-end visuals |
| **Godot**       | Easy to moderate  | Best for small to medium projects, 2D-focused | - Open-source and free <br> - Lightweight and efficient <br> - Excellent for 2D game development | - Smaller community and fewer resources <br> - Less suitable for high-end 3D graphics |
| **CryEngine**   | Steep             | Best for large-scale photorealistic projects | - Cutting-edge graphics and rendering <br> - Access to full engine source code <br> - Powerful physics engine | - Steep learning curve <br> - Limited community support <br> - High system requirements |

<br>

## 2D vs. 3D Complexity  

| **Game Type**  | **Development Time** | **Technical Complexity** |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| **2D Games**  | Shorter             | Lower (simpler assets, physics, and rendering) |
| **3D Games**  | Longer              | Higher (lighting, physics, animation, optimization) |

<br>

While 2D games are easier and faster to develop, **I chose 3D for a more immersive experience**. The additional **depth and realism** make cybersecurity concepts **more engaging** for players.

## Astroguard Development Timeline vs. Industry Averages

| **Experience Level**                           | **Time to Learn Blueprints**  | **Time to Develop a Simple Game** | **Source**  |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **No game dev or programming experience**     | 6 months â€“ 2 years           | 1â€“2 years                        | [Unreal Engine Forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/how-long-to-became-good-with-the-engine/99737) |
| **Programming knowledge, but no game dev experience** | 1â€“3 months | 3â€“6 months | [Kevuru Games](https://kevurugames.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-make-a-game/) |


<br>

Since **Astroguard** was built in just ðŸš€ **2 months** ðŸš€ without prior game development experience, this highlights a significantly faster learning curve than industry averages.

## CS Department Support  

The **Computer Science Department** at **UNCW** supported my project throughout development. My advisor encouraged me to present Astroguard at **CMMC Day in Washington, D.C.**, a cybersecurity conference focused on the Defense Industrial Base. He informed me that the **CS Department would cover travel expenses**, reinforcing their commitment to my research.
